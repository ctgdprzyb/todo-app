# Todo app (React)

### [demo (click me!)](https://ctgd.xyz/todo-app/)

A simple to-do app, written using **React (18.2)** and based on the **[TodoMVC design](https://todomvc.com/)**.

All todos are stored in local storage. You can add, remove, and rename them (by double-clicking), as well as toggle their completion status and use filters.
